            Hi! I'm Fathir Adzan Satia, a vocational high school student from
            West Sumatra, Indonesia. I'm currently studying at SMKN 4
            Payakumbuh, majoring in PPLG (Software and Game Development). I'm
            currently developing my skills as a Front End Developer. When I'm
            not coding, you can find me playing games and playing volleyball -
            those are my favorite ways to relax my mind. I love learning and
            learning new things, such as mastering new skills, trying new
            things, and trying something different that helps me adapt in this
            PPLG major. The drive to learn and mastering new things helps me to
            keep up with the development of technology in today's era.
